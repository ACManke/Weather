Hi Debbie,

This afternoon at 3:30 Taylor fired from the top of your road, 28-30 rounds using two of the louder guns.

This is not a safe shooting location, off the top of a slope. There cannot be any shooting from there, ever. The next time we hear shooting from your property at a location other than your safe target area we will call the sheriff's office and make a complaint.

This makes 3 times Taylor has shot from the top of the slope since the beginning of this year. I am very disappointed that this has continued after all our communication.

Taylor got some targets for Christmas so there are other areas he shoots at but none in your direction. I don’t check my email that often anymore so that’s why a response may be delayed. Hope all is well with you and your family.

I got down behind a little hill, as I couldn't tell where the shots were coming from.  Do you have a target area other than the one at the bottom of your road?

We've asked you a number of times to stop shooting from there. We are careful to be sure of what we're hearing, and there is no mistaking shots fired from that location so close to our house and yard. It doesn't matter how many rounds are fired, or what gun is used, it is unsafe.Recently, Taylor has fired shots from the top of the road on Nov 13, Nov 26, Dec 8, and now Dec 31.

You have set up a safe shooting spot down at the bottom of the hill with targets in the hillside. I am complaining because the last three times we've heard Taylor out shooting he has fired shots from the top of the hill.

The gunfire is audible and disruptive from inside our house, but we always go out onto the patio or the backyard to be sure of where it's coming from. There is no mistaking which location the gunfire is from. On Thursday, Joe arrived home and heard the ATV. Taylor may have been down at the bottom of the hill shooting, but what Joe heard was him riding up the hill, stopping, shooting 6 rounds, and then driving the ATV to park it. On the other recent days I mentioned, the gunfire was only from the top of the slope.

That's Nov 13, Nov 26, and today. I do not feel safe on my property if Taylor has gone back to shooting out into open space from that location. This is a safety issue and safety rules need to be followed every single time. I don't know whether these are Taylor's guns, but you and Bill are responsible for what happens on your property. If Taylor doesn't have the self discipline to follow your family safety procedures then he should not have permission to shoot on your land.

This is not a safe location for shooting, out into open space and not into a dirt berm. Even on a cold damp day like this, I do sometimes go out on our trails.

It's my understanding that they will send somebody out to look over a shooting area for safety. Let me know if you'd like me to set that up. Otherwise, please stop this from happening again.

At 4:15 today, another even louder gun, and altogether 20 minutes of shooting with that and a couple of other firearms. This is a real escalation this fall, with Taylor firing more rounds just about every time he goes out.  I do not want to hear that it had been 12 days since the last time. Everywhere around is quiet, and only your property has so much shooting going on.

I heard 4 different guns, including a very loud one. It went on a while with many many rounds. There were a couple guns fired at once several times through all of this, must have been someone else  diwn there too.

I'm going to keep mentioning it because I don't want things to creep back up to the levels of earlier in the year, and hope it will be much less often at some point. Yesterday after the gunfire Taylor was out for a couple more hours on the ATV making a lot of noise. This was just when the sun had come out and it was nice to be outside. Then he was out riding again at sunset, as usual. Sigh. We notice it, we're bothered by it, and we don't want to have to live with all this noise.

Most of what's going on at your place is not that. What we object to is the disruption and noise of gunfire, week after week, all year round, year after year.

Also of course we appreciate your paying attention to safety - which shouldn't require extra prompting from me!

These days too, your firearms are louder and more powerful.

It's inconsiderate and we don't think we should have to live with it. It seems that target shooting is a hobby that's important to Taylor.  A solution would be for him to go to a shooting range instead.

We may have riding and music noise tonight, not sure if there will be shooting (probably not). It will only be about 1-2 hours. Hope this won’t disturb you.

I appreciate knowing that you have targets, I imagine at the bottom of the hill. Looking back at the emails, on July 24th the shooting was from the top of the hill. That's what is worrisome to us, and we don't want to see that happening again.

I see I missed some emails. You are safe on your trails from our shooting. Shooting is toward our house not yours and at targets with the hillside embankment. Safety is a priority.

Can you make sure there's no shooting and minimize the ATV noise?  We'd appreciate that.

If so, I hope you guys are well, and having a lovely vacation.  We'll catch up when you're back in touch with email.

Joe and I just about jumped out of our skin. Have you and Bill decided that Taylor can just go back to shooting whenever and wherever he likes? That is again 3 times within the last week, and from the location at the top of the hill. I was going to go out this afternoon on our trails, but if he's just shooting out into open space, I do not feel safe.
